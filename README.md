# google-homepage
In this project inspired by <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/foundations/lessons/html-css">The Odin Project</a>, I will recreate the Google homepage. Both of the buttons work as well, so you can use the page to launch a Google search.

The results can be <a href="https://jhjacobson.github.io/google-homepage/">viewed here through GitHub Pages</a>.
